# Introduction {#intro}
Firefox 57 was launched on November 13. So many measurements happening. An
[Impact Dashboard](https://strategy-and-insights.mozilla.com/topline-metrics/index.html) already
exists, though this is more of 57 vs All.

Slack channels are

- 57 impact : https://mozilla.slack.com/messages/G7X2Z795Z (probably invite
  only)
  
This report is analysis of new profiles on 57 and existing profiles that updated
to 57. Seasonality could well be an issue but is something I will gloss over for
